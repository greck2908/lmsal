TODO

- implement model for detecting active regions on HMI images
- train models for other AIA wavelengths

- attempt to retrain AIA193 with simpler images and more test images!

Once AR recognition is working well (only have to be able to do the initial verification):
- compare HMI and AIA data
- http://docs.sunpy.org/en/v0.9.0/generated/gallery/Finding_Local_Peaks_in_Solar_Data.html
- ^ use to generate 3D plots to analyze surface brightness of the active regions over time
- maybe implement Gaussian blurs and analysis of smoothed pixels
- edge-detection, line tracing of AR loops (may be easier with shorter wavelengths)
- try to apply edge enhancing algorithms http://docs.sunpy.org/en/v0.9.0/generated/gallery/loop_edge_enhance.html

- large spreadsheet that ID's and keeps track of active regions (size, time and date, total flux, total intensity, picture)
