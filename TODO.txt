TODO

- implement model for detecting active regions on HMI images
- use masking with threshold value to single out active regions
- sync with AIA detection in order to trace magnetic field lines and correspond them with HMI magnetic field data (which set of poles corresponds to which set of lines)

- line detection (very difficult, read the second research article)

- train models for other AIA wavelengths
