TODO

- implement model for detecting active regions on HMI images
- use masking with threshold value to single out active regions
- sync with AIA detection in order to trace magnetic field lines and correspond them with HMI magnetic field data (which set of poles corresponds to which set of lines)

- line detection (very difficult, read the second research article)

- train models for other AIA wavelengths

Once AR recognition is working well (only have to be able to do the initial verification):
- compare HMI and AIA data
- http://docs.sunpy.org/en/v0.9.0/generated/gallery/Finding_Local_Peaks_in_Solar_Data.html
- ^ use to generate 3D plots to analyze surface brightness of the active regions over time
- maybe implement Gaussian blurs and analysis of smoothed pixels
- edge-detection, line tracing of AR loops
- try to apply edge enhancing algorithms http://docs.sunpy.org/en/v0.9.0/generated/gallery/loop_edge_enhance.html
