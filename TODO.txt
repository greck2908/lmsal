TODO
- implement capability to select a Segment when retrieving HMI data
import drms
c = drms.Client()
si = c.info("hmi.M_720s") [or some other data series]
print si.segments.index.values

- implement model for detecting active regions on HMI images
- use masking with threshold value to single out active regions
- sync with AIA detection in order to trace magnetic field lines and correspond them with HMI magnetic field data (which set of poles corresponds to which set of lines)

- line detection (very difficult, read the second paper Georgios sent me)
