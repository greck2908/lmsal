IDEA FOR YALE VIDEO
OCTOBER 3, 2018
DO WITH ONE PYTHON SCRIPT

- Use 2011-02-15 active region (SW on solar disk)
- Data downloaded at three-minute cadence
- Write short python script to align and delete extraneous data files
- Locate data files containing large flare
- First frame - first data file
- Full-disk animation until large flare (AIA171)
- Pause at large flare and zoom into flare smoothly
- Introduce AIA304 and HMI-M images beside AIA171
- MAYBE: apply Sobel algorithm to AIA171
- Adjust titles of graphs accordingly to the animations performed below
- Animate raw mask generation iteration-by-iteration (AIA304 and HMI-M)
- Animate elliptical mask generation iteration-by-iteration (AIA304 and HMI-M)
- Animate contour mask algorithm - trace points of main contour iteration-by-iteration (AIA304 and HMI-M)
- Introduce plots of intensity vs. time and flux vs. time
- Pause for two seconds
- Continue to show flare (new mask generated for each frame)
- Show ~two seconds of aftermath
- Zoom back out to full-disk and animate until the last data file (AIA171)
