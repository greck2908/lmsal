[ === OUTLINE === ]

[X] Use 2011-02-15 active region (SW on solar disk)
[X] Download data at three-minute cadence
[X] Write short python script to align and delete extraneous data files
[X] Locate data files containing large flare
[] Full-disk animation until large flare (AIA171)
[] Pause at large flare and zoom into flare smoothly
[] Introduce AIA304 and HMI-M images beside AIA171
[] MAYBE: apply Sobel algorithm to AIA171
[] Adjust titles of graphs accordingly to the animations performed below
[] Animate raw mask generation iteration-by-iteration (AIA304 and HMI-M)
[] Animate elliptical mask generation iteration-by-iteration (AIA304 and HMI-M)
[] Animate contour mask generation - trace points of main contour (AIA304 and HMI-M)
[] Introduce plots of intensity vs. time and flux vs. time
[] Pause for two seconds
[] Continue to show flare (new mask generated for each frame)
[] Show ~two seconds of aftermath
[] Zoom back out to full-disk and animate until the last data file (AIA171)

[ === NOTES === ]

Access X-class flare information:
tstart = "2011/02/15 00:00:00"  
tend = "2011/02/15 03:00:00"  
result = client.query(hek.attrs.Time(tstart, tend), hek.attrs.EventType(e)) 
max(result)
