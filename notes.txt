NOTES

- large spreadsheet that ID's and keeps track of active regions (size, location, time and date, total flux, total intensity, average intensity)

process:
logging of loop information over large dataset
	- ensure that loop is within the solar disk (pixel bounds check)
image subtraction to remove noise
edge detection algorithm applied to loop locations
use locations of the coronal loops to determine total magnetic flux
use algorithm to automatically determine bounds of coronal loops
calculate average electromagnetic intensity, record
calculate total magnetic flux (HMI), record
generate large graph and best fit trend
